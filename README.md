# Fake News Checker (Keyword Based)

This is a simple Python project that checks whether a news headline is likely to be fake or real using keywords.

## How it works
The program scans the news text for suspicious words such as:
- shocking
- unbelievable
- leaked
- miracle
- guaranteed

If such words are found, it marks the news as "Possibly Fake".

## How to run
1. Install Python
2. Run:
   python fake_news_checker.py
3. Type a news headline when asked

## Disclaimer
This is only a keyword-based project for learning purpose. It is NOT an accurate fake news detector.
